Select the version of terragrunt you require by using the up and down arrow. Hit Enter to select the desired version. The most recently selected versions are presented at the top of the dropdown. Supply version on command line You can also supply the desired version as an argument on the command line. For example, tgswitch 0.37.1 for version 0.37.1 of terragrunt. Hit Enter to switch. Use environment variables You can also set the TG_VERSION environment variable to your desired terragrunt version. For example: export TG_VERSION=0.37.0 tgswitch #will automatically switch to terragrunt version 0.37.0 Use .tgswitch.toml file (For non-admin AND Apple M1 users with limited privilege on their computers) Specify a custom binary path for your terragrunt installation Create a custom binary path. Ex: mkdir /Users/uveerum/bin (replace uveerum with your username) Add the path to your PATH. Ex: export PATH=$PATH:/Users/uveerum/bin (add this to your bash profile or zsh profile) Pass -b or --bin parameter with your custom path to install terragrunt. Ex: tgswitch -b /Users/uveerum/bin/terragrunt 0.34.0 Optionally, you can create a .tgswitch.toml file in your terragrunt directory(current directory) OR in your home directory(~/.tgswitch.toml). The toml file in the current directory has a higher precedence than toml file in the home directory Your .tgswitch.toml file should look like this: bin = \"/usr/local/bin/terragrunt\" version = \"0.34.0\" Run tgswitch and it should automatically install the required terragrunt version in the specified binary path NOTE 1. For linux users that do not have write permission to /usr/local/bin/ , tgswitch will attempt to install terragrunt at $HOME/bin . Run export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin to append bin to PATH 2. For windows host, tgswitch need to be run under Administrator mode, and $HOME/.tgswitch.toml with bin must be defined (with a valid path) as minimum, below is an example for $HOME/.tgswitch.toml on windows bin = \"C:\\\\Users\\\\<%USRNAME%>\\\\bin\\\\terragrunt.exe\" Use .tgswitchrc file Create a .tgswitchrc file containing the desired version For example, echo \"0.33.0\" >> .tgswitchrc for version 0.33.0 of terragrunt Run the command tgswitch in the same directory as your .tgswitchrc Instead of a .tgswitchrc file, a .terragrunt-version file may be used as well Use terragrunt.hcl file If a terragrunt.hcl file with the terragrunt constrain is included in the current directory, it should automatically download or switch to that terragrunt version. For example, the following should automatically switch terragrunt to version 0.36.0: terragrunt_version_constraint = \">= 0.36, < 0.36.1\" ... Get the version from a subdirectory tgswitch --chdir terragrunt_dir tgswitch -c terragrunt_dir Automatically switch with bash Add the following to the end of your ~/.bashrc file: (Use either .tgswitchrc or .tgswitch.toml or .terragrunt-version ) cdtgswitch(){ builtin cd \"$@\"; cdir=$PWD; if [ -e \"$cdir/.tgswitchrc\" ]; then tgswitch fi } alias cd='cdtgswitch' Automatically switch with zsh Add the following to the end of your ~/.zshrc file: load-tgswitch() { local tgswitchrc_path=\".tgswitchrc\" if [ -f \"$tgswitchrc_path\" ]; then tgswitch fi } add-zsh-hook chpwd load-tgswitch load-tgswitch NOTE: if you see an error like this: command not found: add-zsh-hook , then you might be on an older version of zsh (see below), or you simply need to load add-zsh-hook by adding this to your .zshrc : autoload -U add-zsh-hook older version of zsh cd(){ builtin cd \"$@\"; cdir=$PWD; if [ -e \"$cdir/.tgswitchrc\" ]; then tgswitch fi } Automatically switch with fish shell Add the following to the end of your ~/.config/fish/config.fish file: function switch_terragrunt --on-event fish_postexec string match --regex '^cd\\s' \"$argv\" > /dev/null set --local is_command_cd $status if test $is_command_cd -eq 0 if count *.tf > /dev/null grep -c \"required_version\" *.tf > /dev/null set --local tf_contains_version $status if test $tf_contains_version -eq 0 command tgswitch end end end end","title":"Quick Start"},{"location":"Quick-Start/#how-to-use","text":"","title":"How to use:"},{"location":"Quick-Start/#use-dropdown-menu-to-select-version","text":"You can switch between different versions of terragrunt by typing the command tgswitch on your terminal.
